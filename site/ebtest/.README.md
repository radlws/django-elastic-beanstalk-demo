# Introduction

The Trapeze app provides tools that automate processes in the Trapeze development workflow.

# Installation

Add `trapeze` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        # django apps...

        # other reusable apps...
        'trapeze',

        # project-specific apps...
    )



# Usage


## Commands

All commands can be executed via `./manage.py`. For example:

    ./manage.py load_devdata

The following commands are available:

* `checkstyle`: Check your code against most of our style guide (uses [pep8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [pyflakes](https://launchpad.net/pyflakes))
* `clean_files`: Remove media/files not referenced from the database.
* `dump_devdata`: Dumps the database and media files to the devdata folder (`../../devdata` by default)
* `load_devdata`: Loads the sql dump and media files from the devdata folder
* `test_all`: replaces `./test_all.py`, run all tests (including the ones from reusable apps)
* `pip_install`: Installs your app into ../lib of your repository

DEPRECATED:

* `get_app` and `update`: Installs/Exports the latest version of an app
* load_devdata and dump_devdata are used but are also part of django-dumbo

The commands `upgrade` and `get_app` require the following packages:

    sudo apt-get install python-svn

## Settings

To disable the auto-generation of checkstyle tests for each Python (.py/.py.ex) file in your project:

    CHECKSTYLE_TESTS_ENABLED = False

## Ignoring Lines in Checkstyle

You can mark a line to be ignored by checkstyle by adding in a comment `checkstyle-ignore`.

For example,

    import unused  # checkstyle-ignore

will pass checkstyle.

## Setting up Git hooks

Before you make a commit, you will want to make sure that your code meets our style guide. To do that for a git project, you will need to set up a pre-commit git hook.

In your project, create the following shell script named `pre-commit` and place it in `<project>/.git/hooks/`:

    #!/bin/sh
    MANAGE_COMMAND=`find . -maxdepth 3 -type f -name 'manage.py'`
    cd `dirname $MANAGE_COMMAND`
    python manage.py checkstyle
    exit $?

The third line finds the location of the Django `manage.py` script and changes the directory to there before running that script in the fourth line.

You can also run all tests before you commit by adding `&& python manage.py test` to the checkstyle line like this:

    python manage.py checkstyle && python manage.py test

## Usage for pip_install

Examples:

    ./manage.py pip_install git+https://github.com/RobCombs/django-locking.git
    ./manage.py pip_install django-extensions django-debug-toolbar

Known limitations:

* when installing multiple applications, a new "pip install" command is called for each one
* no dependencies are currently pulled in
* none of the flags that pip uses are accessible
* Can't install from requirements.txt
